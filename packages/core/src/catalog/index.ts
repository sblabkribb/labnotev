/**
 * Bundled workflow / unit-operation catalogs.

 * These JSON files are the SINGLE SOURCE of the default catalogs. They are

 * plugin bundle (esbuild), because Obsidian community plugins ship only
 * `main.js` / `manifest.json` / `styles.css` and cannot rely on loose files
 * on disk. The extension seeds an editable workspace copy from these
 * constants (see `ensureWorkflowResources`).
